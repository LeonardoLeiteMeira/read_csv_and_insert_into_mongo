# Reading industry database and insert into local mogoDB
[Database used from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inIT-OWL/one-year-industrial-component-degradation?resource=download&select=04-05T165053_209_mode1.csv)

The 'database_industry_oneyeardata' folder has all 519 CSV files from database_industry.zip

## Motivation
In my master's I will work with industry database, so I used this sample to do some tests. This code just read the CSV's, converto into Register class, and insert it into mongoDB.
